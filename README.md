# EPFL upper limb musculoskeletal model

This upper limb musculoskeletal model was developed at the EPFL by David Ingram and Ehsan Sarshari. It is implemented in Matlab. The details are explained in README files within each of the following subfolders.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project locally.

* Clone the repository locally
* Start matlab and set path one of the model's directorie (see below).

## Description of the model

ShoulderModel

This folder contains the musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder and elbow that can replicate healthy subjects and patients with osteoarthritis.
